              We felt the need to test the site thoroughly, considering it was
              our first e-commerce site, and we didnt want to negatively impact
              our customers.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Like many companies, we didnt have professional testers in-house,
              and thats where Automation Solutionz came to the rescue. Their
              automated testing platform, ZeuZ, was able to develop automated
              test scripts that examined every aspect of our site and provided
              valuable feedback. This feedback helped us make the necessary
              changes to deliver a site that would meet and exceed our customers
              expectations.

              The team at Automation Solutionz is incredible. We initially
              sought a company to thoroughly test our site, but we ended up with
              a partner on our journey to becoming an industry-leading
              e-commerce solution in our field. Im not sure how we would have
              achieved our goals without their timely assistance!

              I have never been able to create test cases as easily and quickly
              until I used the ZeuZ platform. I can track projects easily and
              oversee the work of every tester on the team which makes the
              entire project move along with less hiccups.

              ZeuZ will be extremely beneficial to those people that are
              visually oriented. The entire system is displayed in a way that
              takes out the complexity of organizing a project and adds a clean,
              sleek layout.

              The fact that ZeuZ creates test cases at the step level gives you
              a lot more incite from test reports.​

              In order to automate simultaneous testing of multiple mobile
              devices, cloud (REST API) along with simulated bluetooth device as
              shown above, I am convinced that it would have taken an enormous
              amount of time, cost and resource in achieving measurable results
              through major competing frameworks like QTP, Renorax, or
              SmartBear. ZeuZs expert consultancy and local presence truly made
              it a no-brainer for us unlike any other outsourcing arrangement we
              ever imagined or had experience of, in the past.
