            <h4>3. Share</h4>
            <p>

              Service(s). Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by
              the service agreements with our sub-contractors. Such
              sub-contractors may include third-party payment processors who
              process your credit card and other payment information for ZeuZ
              but are otherwise not permitted to store, retain or use such
              information.

            <h4>4. Correction or Removal of Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
              If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your
              personal information and you would like to request that it be

              ZeuZ acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal
              information. ZeuZ collects information on behalf of our customers,
              and has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our
              customers may interact using the Service(s). If you are a customer
              of one of our customers (“End-Customer”) and would no longer like
              to be contacted by that customer, please contact the customer that
              you interact with directly. An individual who seeks access, or who
              seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct
              his query to the ZeuZ’s customer (the data controller). If
              requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <h4>5. Other Information</h4>
            <p>
              Other information such as End-Customer device models, IP address,
              usage patterns are also captured by the Service(s). This
              information is not used by ZeuZ except in allowing you to view and
              use this information for targeting future communication with the
              End-Customers. Content and messages in voice, text or other format
              created by you or your End-Customers to send or share with other
              users or End-Customers shall be hosted on ZeuZ’s servers.
            </p>

            <h4>6. Retention of Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
              We retain Personal Data we process for as long as an Account is
              active or as needed to provide the Service(s). If you wish to
              terminate your Account or request that we no longer use Your Data,
              please contact us at info@ZeuZ.ai. We will retain Your Data as
              necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate
              financial and other records, resolve disputes, and enforce our
              agreements. We delete all your data once you raise the request to
              info@ZeuZ.ai except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law or
              in order to maintain accurate financial records.
            </p>

            <h4>7. Processing Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
              We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the
              information on our platform for purposes of the EU General Data
              Protection Regulation “GDPR” (adopted in April 2016). Our EEA
              based customers, who control their customer data and send it to
              ZeuZ for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are
              responsible for compliance with the GDPR. In particular, ZeuZ’s
              customers are responsible for complying with the GDPR and relevant
              data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state
              before sending personal information to ZeuZ for processing. We
              work with our customers to help them provide notice to their
              customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is
              collected. We store and process data, including personal
              information, in Canada, the United States and the European
              Economic Area (“EEA”) and possibly in other countries through
              third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service(s).
              When you access or use our Websites or the Service(s), or
              otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf
              of you and your authorized agents or End-Customers, (and
              representing that you have the authority to provide such consent)
              to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United
              States and other countries which may have different privacy laws
              from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps
              reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
              and in accordance with this Policy. We may enter agreements with
              our customers located in the EEA to provide them access to our
              Service(s), which includes the processing of information relating
              the End-Customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored
              or processed on our platform, and in fact we are largely unaware
              of what information is being stored on our platform and only
              access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the
              Service(s) (including to respond to support requests), as
              otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. It
              shall be our customers’ responsibility to inform the End-Customers
              about and obtain necessary consent for any personal information
              that is collected through our customer’s use of the Service(s). As
              the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers,
              we follow their instructions with respect to the information they
              control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our
              Service(s). In doing so, we implement technical, physical and
              administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such
              information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to,
              personal information as more fully described under the section
              below entitled, “Protection of Information”.
            </p>

            <h4>8. Analytics</h4>
            <p>
              ZeuZ uses third party software for analytics. All metrics
              information collected from your usage of the Service(s) shall be
              transmitted to analytics provider(s). This information is then
              used to evaluate how users use ZeuZ, and to compile statistical
              reports on activity for us. We further use the same statistical
              analytics tool to track or to collect your Personally Identifiable
              Information (PII). We will use this information in order to
              maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Service(s)
              and to personalize the experience for you. Aggregated information
              and analysis may be made public where desired by ZeuZ. Third party
              analytics software will not share your PII or associate your PII
              with any other data held by them.
            </p>

            <h4>10. Usage of Gifs/PNG/JPG/JPEG/SVG and Log Files</h4>
            <p>
              We and our third party advertising partners use technologies such
              as web beacons in analyzing trends, administering the website,
              tracking users’ movements around the site, and gathering
              demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may
              receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these
              companies on an individual and aggregated basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
              automatically and store it in log files. This information may
              include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
              service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system,
              date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We link this
              automatically collected data to other information we collect about
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do Not Track: Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting
              that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by
              advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that
              recognizes DNT signals from your web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our
              Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third
              party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather
              information about your activities on this Website and other sites
              in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing
              activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information
              used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may
              opt-out by sending a request to info@ZeuZ.ai. Please note this
              does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to
              receive generic ads.
            </p>

            <h4>11. Social Media Features</h4>
            <p>
              Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook
              “Like” button, the “Share This” button or interactive
              mini-programs. Where we have your consent, these features may
              collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our
              Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
              properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a
              third party or hosted directly on our Websites. Your interactions

              company providing them.
            </p>
            <h4>12. Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
            <p>

              We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Websites and to
              read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects
              personal information.
            </p>

            <h4>13. Communications from the Website(s)</h4>
            <p>
              We may use your email address to send our newsletters and/ or
              marketing communications. If you no longer wish to receive these
              communications, you can opt out by following the instructions
              contained in the emails you receive or by contacting us at
              info@ZeuZ.ai.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will send you announcements related to the Service(s) on
              occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our
              Service(s) is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send
              you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of communications
              which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive
              them, you may deactivate your Account.
            </p>

            <h4>14. Advertising</h4>
            <p>
              We partner with third-party advertising networks to either display
              advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other
              websites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and Web beacons
              to collect information about your activities on our Website and
              other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
              interests (this will only be the case if we have your consent in
              certain locations).
            </p>

            <h4>15. Protection of Information</h4>
            <p>
              The Websites and Service(s) have industry standard security
              measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and
              alteration of the information under our control. When you provide
              us with sensitive information (such as credit card information),
              we will encrypt that information via Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
            </p>
