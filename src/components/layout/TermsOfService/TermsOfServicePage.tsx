            <h4>21. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES</h4>

            <p>
              a. Purpose. This Section 21 sets forth the circumstances and
              procedures under which Claims (as defined below) that arise
              between you and us will be resolved through BINDING ARBITRATION
              instead of litigated in court. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR WE
              WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY
              TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM, OR TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED
              FOR IN THE RULES (AS DEFINED BELOW). OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD
              HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN
              ARBITRATION, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOUR ABILITY TO
              PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE
              ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NOTE THAT OTHER
              RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE
              AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. Nothing in this provision precludes you
              from filing and pursuing your individual Claim in a small claims
              court in your state or municipality, so long as that Claim is
              pending only in that court.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. Scope. We each agree that all claims arising out of or related
              to these Terms of Service (“Claims”) will be submitted exclusively
              to binding arbitration as set forth in this Section. This
              agreement to arbitrate applies to all Claims that could have been
              filed in court regarding the Claims, whether you or we are the
              first to file a Claim with the arbitral tribunal and whether the
              Claims are against you or us, or ours or your employees, agents,
              contractors or suppliers. This agreement to arbitrate covers all
              Claims under these Terms of Service, regardless of whether such
              Claim is based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, common law
              or equity, including, but not limited to, Claims arising out of or
              related to: (1) the interpretation, execution, administration,
              amendment or modification of these Terms of Service; (2) any
              alleged breach of these Terms of Service or tort, (3) the Site,
              ZeuZ Server/Node, Services, any transaction, features or services
              (whether provided by us or another service provider), any
              advertisement or solicitation, or your business, interaction or
              relationship with us; (4) any charge or cost incurred pursuant to
              these Terms of Service or the collection of any amounts due under
              these Terms of Service; and (5) any statements or representations
              made by us to you with respect to these Terms of Service, the
              Site, ZeuZ Server/Node, Services, any transaction, features or
              services (whether provided by us or another service provider) or
              any advertisement or solicitation, or your business, interaction
              or relationship with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              c. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of
              Administrator. Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by
              you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this Section 21 and the code
              of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which
              the Claim is referred in effect at the time the Claim is filed
              (“Rules”), except to the extent that the Rules conflict with these
              Terms of Service. Claims shall be referred to either the Judicial
              Arbitration and Mediation Services in Toronto, Canada (“JAMS”) or
              the Canadian Arbitration Association (“CAA”), as selected by the
              party electing to initiate arbitration. If a selection by us of
              one of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you shall have
              the right within 30 days after you receive notice of our election
              to select the other organization listed to serve as arbitrator
              administrator. For a copy of the procedures, to file a Claim or
              for other information about these organizations, contact them as
              follows: (i) JAMS in Toronto at 77 King Street West, Suite 2020,
              Toronto, ON, M5K 1A1, website at jamsadr.com/jams-toronto; or (ii)
              CAA at 80 Duncan Mill Road, 4th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M3B 1Z6,
              website at canadianarbitrationassociation.ca.
            </p>
            <p>
              d. Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions. If either party
              elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be
              arbitrated on an individual basis. There shall be no right or
              authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis
              or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative
              capacity on behalf of the general public, other Cardholders or
              other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to
              resolve Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and
              the arbitrator’s authority to make awards is limited to you and us
              alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us
              against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with
              Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless
              otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration
              award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or
              claims in any Dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the
              arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms of
              Service (including the “Continuation” provision below), and
              without waiving either party’s right of appeal, if any portion of
              this “Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions” provision is
              deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Section 21 (other
              than this sentence) shall not apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              e. Location of Arbitration/Payment of Fees. Any arbitration
              hearing that you attend shall take place anywhere in Canada
              (provincial judicial district of your residence). At your written
              request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance
              of all or part of the filing administrative and/or hearing fees
              for any Claim you initiate if your damages does not exceed $75,000
              as to which you or we seek arbitration. Waivers may also be
              available from the JAMS or CAA. At the conclusion of the
              arbitration (or any appeal thereof), the arbitrator (or panel)
              will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying the
              filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in connection with the
              arbitration (or appeal). If and to the extent you incur filing,
              administrative and/or hearing fees in arbitration, including for
              any appeal, exceeding the amount they would have been if the Claim
              had been brought in the state or federal court which is closest to
              your billing address and would have had jurisdiction over the
              Claim, we will reimburse you to that extent unless the arbitrator
              (or panel) determines that the fees were incurred without any
              substantial justification.
            </p>
            <p>
              f. Arbitration Procedures. For any dispute you have with ZeuZ, you
              agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with
              us informally. If ZeuZ has not been able to resolve the dispute
              with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute,
              or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
              relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these
              Terms by binding arbitration by the Canadian Arbitration
              Association under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in
              effect for the CAA, except as provided herein. You agree to
              provide ZeuZ with a copy of your claim within fiteen (15) days of
              submitting the claim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking
              injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters
              related to intellectual property or unauthorized access to the
              Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              g. Survival; Severability. This Section 21 shall survive
              termination of these Terms of Service, the relationship between
              you and us, any permitted transfer, sale or assignment, or any
              amounts owed, to any other person or entity as well as voluntary
              payment of any debt in full by you, any legal proceeding by or
              between you and us to collect a debt owed by you, and any
              bankruptcy by you or us. If any portion of this Section 21, except
              the “Class Action Waiver and Other Restrictions” provision above,
              is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not
              invalidate the remaining portions of this Section 21, these Terms
              of Service or any prior agreement you may have had with us, each
              of which shall be enforceable regardless of such invalidity.
            </p>
            <p>
              IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SITE, ZeuZ
